There are several ways to read data from sample-data.json, in the real scenario it would be read from web service.

For that reason, I created a dummy json-server to simulate the web service.

Also in a real project, I would have two separate components for search aren and employee list, and use redux to manage state. To simplify the issue, I combined them together.

I may submit another version using redux later.
